# Extending Materials
Plugin for extending built-in materials, instances of ShaderMaterial and built-in materials as well as shader objects of `onBeforeCompile`.

[**Demo**](https://codepen.io/Fyrestar/pen/jOqyppp?editors=0010): Creating new materials based on MeshStandardMaterial and custom depth material for shadows

`THREE.extendMaterial( constructor|material|shaderMaterial [, options])`

For patching in onBeforeCompile:
`THREE.patchShader( object [, options])`



```javascript

const myMaterial = THREE.extendMaterial(THREE.MeshPhongMaterial, {

	// Will be prepended to vertex and fragment code
	header: 'varying vec3 vEye;',

	// Will be prepended to vertex code
	headerVertex: '',

	// Will be prepended to fragment code
	headerFragment: '',

	// If desired, the material class to create can be defined such as RawShaderMaterial or ShaderMaterial, by
	// default in order to seamlessly work with in-built features the CustomMaterial class provided by this
	// plugin is used which is a slightly extended ShaderMaterial.
	// class: THREE.ShaderMaterial,

	// Insert code lines by hinting at a existing
	vertex: {

		// Inserts the line after #include <fog_vertex>

		'#include <fog_vertex>': 'vEye = normalize(cameraPosition - w.xyz);',

		// Replaces a line (@ prefix) inside of the project_vertex include

		'project_vertex': {
			'@vec4 mvPosition = modelViewMatrix * vec4( transformed, 1.0 );': 'vec4 mvPosition = modelViewMatrix * vec4( transformed * 0.5, 1.0 );'
		}
	},
	fragment: {
		'#include <envmap_fragment>': 'diffuseColor.rgb += pow(dot(vNormal, vEye), 3.0);'
	},


	// Properties to apply to the new THREE.ShaderMaterial
	material: {
		skinning: true
	},


	// Uniforms (will be applied to existing or added) as value or uniform object
	uniforms: {

		// Use a value directly, uniform object will be created for or ..
		diffuse: new THREE.Color(0xffffff),

		// ... provide the uniform object, by declaring a shared: true property and such you can ensure
		// the object will be shared across materials rather than cloned.
		emissive: {
			shared: true, // This uniform can be shared across all materials it gets assigned to, sharing the value
			mixed : true, // When creating a material with/from a template this will be passed through
			linked: true, // To share them when used as template but not when extending them further, this ensures you donâ€™t have
						  // to sync. uniforms from your original material with the depth material for shadows for example (see Demo)
			value: new THREE.Color('pink')
		}
	}

});
```

## Patching shader code

Code can be appended, prepended and replaced by providing some indicating line code (typically includes like above) and a prefix to define if the code should be appended, prepended to the hinted line or replace it.

Prefix | Insertion
--- | ---
none | append
? | prepend
@ | replace

## Templates

When creating a material variation such as a depth material and the previous patched code should be applied too, defining a template will apply all previous patches again. This is useful when creating alternative versions, for example a custom depth material that also respects custom vertex transformations.

For example, you extended MeshStandardMaterial with some vertex distortions to add wind motion.

```javascript
const depthMaterial = THREE.extendMaterial( THREE.MeshDepthMaterial, {
	
	template: myMaterial
	
});
```

# Release notes

## Fix

- Adapted compatibility with 127+ releases (es6 classes)
- Module version added

## Version 2

- A new `THREE.CustomMaterial` which stays more compatible to the in-built materials when extending those
- `class` property in options to use another material class than ShaderMaterial (e.g CustomMaterial)
- `mixed` property in uniforms to pass them from templates
- `linked` property in uniforms to share them when used as template but **not** when extending them, this ensures you don't have to sync. uniforms from your original material with the depth material for shadows for example
- Compatibility with RawShaderMaterial
- Uniforms can be given now as wrapper-object or their value
- Cloning materials now respects shared uniforms
- Alias `THREE.extendMaterial` as shorter alternative to `THREE.ShaderMaterial.extend`
- Fixed compatibility with minified THREE bundles
- Templates (applying of previous code patches and inheriting properties)
- Sharing of uniform wrapper by defining a shared `{shared: true, value: .. }` boolean in a uniform object
- vertexHeader, fragmentHeader, vertexEnd, fragmentEnd added wich will only add the given string to the corresponding part while the "End" ones will add the string at the end of the main function
- Constants (defines) which are a boolean false will get removed as they are mainly used with #ifdef in THREE what causes a false positive for this condition
- `customDepthMaterial` and `customDistanceMaterial` can be also defined on materials now, so it doesn't need to be assigned for every new mesh with this material
- Uniforms are reduced to what has been defined at least with null and necessary pairs (for example normalMapScale when normalMap is defined), this saves a large amount of uniforms that aren't used
- Lights uniforms are now shared instead cloned for every material (it's a huge set), internally THREE assigns the value for all equally anyway
